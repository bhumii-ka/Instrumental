This project aims to create a website having various instruments to be played with the help of keyboard.
At present it only has drums included.

###### Instructions
- The audio will be played till the time you're holding a key. The moment when you release the key audio will be stopped.
- Pressing multiple keys at a time is supported and will result in sounds by different instruments.
- Holding a key for long will result in looping the audio.
- For now drum sounds can only be played by pressing keys on keyboard (not with mouse).
